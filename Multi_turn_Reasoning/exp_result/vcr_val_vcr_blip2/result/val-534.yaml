          You will be provided with:

          1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.

          2. Although you won''t be able to directly view the image, you will receive
          a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an
          overall description.


          Your goal is:

          To effectively analyze the image and select the correct answer for the question,
          you should break down the main question into several sub-questions that
          address the key aspects of the image.


          Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.

          1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions
          shouldn''t mention previous sub-questions.

          2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?;
          Sub-question 2: ...?".

          3. Each sub-question should start with "What".

          4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.

          5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.


          Example:


          Main question: What is happening in the image?

          Sub-question 1: What objects or subjects are present in the image?

          Sub-question 2: What actions or events is the person doing?

          Sub-question 3: What are the emotions or expressions of the woman?

          Sub-question 4: What is the brand of this car? '

      - content: 'Analysis: Based on the given information, we know that the person
          on the left is wearing a military uniform and is in the context of a formal
          event. The person on the right is also wearing a red jacket, which suggests
          that they may have some connection or similarity. Additionally, there are
          other people or objects in the image that could be influencing the person''s
          smile. Given these details, it is more likely that the person on the left
          is smiling because he has just finished telling the person on the right
          something good, possibly related to their shared context or connection.


          More Likely Answer: 1. He has just finished telling person on the right
          something good.'
