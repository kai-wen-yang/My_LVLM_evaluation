          You will be provided with:

          1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.

          2. Although you won''t be able to directly view the image, you will receive
          a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an
          overall description.


          Your goal is:

          To effectively analyze the image and select the correct answer for the question,
          you should break down the main question into several sub-questions that
          address the key aspects of the image.


          Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.

          1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions
          shouldn''t mention previous sub-questions.

          2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?;
          Sub-question 2: ...?".

          3. Each sub-question should start with "What".

          4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.

          5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.


          Example:


          Main question: What is happening in the image?

          Sub-question 1: What objects or subjects are present in the image?

          Sub-question 2: What actions or events is the person doing?

          Sub-question 3: What are the emotions or expressions of the woman?

          Sub-question 4: What is the brand of this car? '

          Main Question: Why is person on the left here on this deck?

          Answer 4: person on the left is person on the right child who is also on
          the ship.
