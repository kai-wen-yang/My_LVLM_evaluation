          You will be provided with:

          1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.

          2. Although you won''t be able to directly view the image, you will receive
          a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an
          overall description.


          Your goal is:

          To effectively analyze the image and select the correct answer for the question,
          you should break down the main question into several sub-questions that
          address the key aspects of the image.


          Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.

          1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions
          shouldn''t mention previous sub-questions.

          2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?;
          Sub-question 2: ...?".

          3. Each sub-question should start with "What".

          4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.

          5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.


          Example:


          Main question: What is happening in the image?

          Sub-question 1: What objects or subjects are present in the image?

          Sub-question 2: What actions or events is the person doing?

          Sub-question 3: What are the emotions or expressions of the woman?

          Sub-question 4: What is the brand of this car? '

          Main Question: What is person in the middle going to do next?

          Four choices:

          Answer 1: person on the right is going to knock on the door.

          Answer 2: person on the left is going to jump behind the bush and ambush
          person in the middle.

          Answer 3: person in the middle is going to ask person on the left out on
          a date.

          Answer 4: person on the left is going to start running home.


          Please list the sub-questions following the requirement I mentioned before.

      - content: 'Analysis: Based on the given sub-questions and answers, we can infer
          that the person in the middle is currently smiling, indicating a positive
          and friendly interaction. The body language and facial expression also suggest
          a friendly demeanor. Additionally, the relationship between the person in
          the middle and the other two individuals is described as friends. Considering
          these factors, it is unlikely that the person on the left would jump behind
          a bush and ambush the person in the middle, as it contradicts the friendly
          nature of the interaction. It is also unlikely that the person on the left
          would start running home, as there is no indication of any negative or threatening
          situation. The person on the right knocking on the door seems unrelated
          to the given information. Therefore, the more likely answer is that the
          person in the middle is going to ask the person on the left out on a date,
          as it aligns with the positive interaction, friendly relationship, and the
          possibility of a romantic interest.


          More Likely Answer: 3. person in the middle is going to ask person on the
          left out on a date.'
