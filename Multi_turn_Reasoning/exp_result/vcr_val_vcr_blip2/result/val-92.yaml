          You will be provided with:

          1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.

          2. Although you won''t be able to directly view the image, you will receive
          a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an
          overall description.


          Your goal is:

          To effectively analyze the image and select the correct answer for the question,
          you should break down the main question into several sub-questions that
          address the key aspects of the image.


          Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.

          1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions
          shouldn''t mention previous sub-questions.

          2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?;
          Sub-question 2: ...?".

          3. Each sub-question should start with "What".

          4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.

          5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.


          Example:


          Main question: What is happening in the image?

          Sub-question 1: What objects or subjects are present in the image?

          Sub-question 2: What actions or events is the person doing?

          Sub-question 3: What are the emotions or expressions of the woman?

          Sub-question 4: What is the brand of this car? '

          Main Question: What is person on the left going to do about it?

          Four choices:

          Answer 1: person on the left is going to try to weed out corruption in his
          high shcool.

          Answer 2: He '' s going to run water through it.

          Answer 3: He will call someone to negotiate.

          Answer 4: person on the right is going to finish his story with person on
          the left.


          Please list the sub-questions following the requirement I mentioned before.

      - content: 'Analysis: Based on the given information, we know that the person
          on the left is holding scissors and appears to be angry. The room is described
          as an office, and there are no other objects or people in the room that
          might provide clues about what the person on the left is going to do. Given
          these details, it is unlikely that the person on the left is going to run
          water through something or finish a story with the person on the right.
          The options of "person on the left is going to try to weed out corruption
          in his high school" and "he will call someone to negotiate" seem more plausible.
          However, since the person is described as angry and holding scissors, it
          is more likely that they are going to take some sort of action to address
          the situation directly. Therefore, the more likely answer is Answer 1: person
          on the left is going to try to weed out corruption in his high school.


          More Likely Answer: 1.'
