          You will be provided with:

          1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.

          2. Although you won''t be able to directly view the image, you will receive
          a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an
          overall description.


          Your goal is:

          To effectively analyze the image and select the correct answer for the question,
          you should break down the main question into several sub-questions that
          address the key aspects of the image.


          Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.

          1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions
          shouldn''t mention previous sub-questions.

          2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?;
          Sub-question 2: ...?".

          3. Each sub-question should start with "What".

          4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.

          5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.


          Example:


          Main question: What is happening in the image?

          Sub-question 1: What objects or subjects are present in the image?

          Sub-question 2: What actions or events is the person doing?

          Sub-question 3: What are the emotions or expressions of the woman?

          Sub-question 4: What is the brand of this car? '

          Main Question: Why is person on the left upset?

          Four choices:

          weird in the doorway.

          Answer 3: Something bad just happened.

          Answer 4: person on the left can not believe person on the right are drinking
          beer at a classy wine - drinking event.

      - content: 'Analysis: Based on the sub-questions and corresponding answers,
          we can infer that the person on the left is upset because they are being
          arrested. The answer to the sub-question "What is the person on the left
          doing?" indicates that the person on the left is arresting someone, which
          suggests that they are likely a police officer. The answer to the sub-question
          "What is the expression on the person''s face on the left?" indicates that
          the person on the left is scared, which aligns with the idea that they are
          upset about their own situation. Additionally, the answer to the sub-question
          "What is the person on the right doing?" suggests that the person on the
          right is grabbing something, which could be interpreted as them restraining
          or apprehending the person on the left. The context or setting of the image
          being a police station further supports the idea that the person on the
          left is upset because they are being arrested.


          More Likely Answer: 2. person on the left is upset because they are being
          arrested.'
