          You will be provided with:

          1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.

          2. Although you won''t be able to directly view the image, you will receive
          a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an
          overall description.


          Your goal is:

          To effectively analyze the image and select the correct answer for the question,
          you should break down the main question into several sub-questions that
          address the key aspects of the image.


          Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.

          1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions
          shouldn''t mention previous sub-questions.

          2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?;
          Sub-question 2: ...?".

          3. Each sub-question should start with "What".

          4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.

          5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.


          Example:


          Main question: What is happening in the image?

          Sub-question 1: What objects or subjects are present in the image?

          Sub-question 2: What actions or events is the person doing?

          Sub-question 3: What are the emotions or expressions of the woman?

          Sub-question 4: What is the brand of this car? '

          Main Question: What will person on the left probably do with the mirror?

          Four choices:

          Answer 1: person on the left is likely to use wineglass.

          Answer 2: person on the left will look into the mirror.

          Answer 3: person on the right will cut the hair of person on the left.

          Answer 4: person on the right will go and open the item.


          Please list the sub-questions following the requirement I mentioned before.

          \ we can infer that the person on the left is holding a cigarette and the\
          \ person on the right is looking in the mirror. The person on the left is\
          \ likely to use the mirror to look at herself, as indicated by the answer\
          \ to the sub-question. The answer choices can be evaluated based on this\
          \ information. Answer 1, which suggests that the person on the left will\
          \ use a wineglass, does not align with the information provided. Answer\
          \ 2, which states that the person on the left will look into the mirror,\
          \ is consistent with the sub-question answer and seems to be the most likely\
          \ option. Answer 3, which involves the person on the right cutting the hair\
